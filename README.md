Emotion Detection
The player uses MediaPipe Face Mesh technology to detect your facial expressions and recommend music based on your current mood:

😊 Happy: Suggests similar upbeat songs or new untagged tracks
😢 Sad: Recommends happy and uplifting music to improve your mood
😐 Neutral: Offers a mix of songs matching your current state
Emotion Tagging System
The player allows you to manually tag songs with emotions to improve recommendations:

0 - Untagged: Songs that haven't been assigned an emotion yet
1 - Happy: Upbeat, energetic, and positive songs
2 - Sad: Melancholic, slow, or emotional songs
3 - Neutral: Songs with balanced emotional content
Tagged songs are stored in an emotions.json file and used to enhance the recommendation system.
